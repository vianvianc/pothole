<h1>Pothole Trackerâ€”Sprint 1: Planning and Wireframes</h1>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>Pothole Tracker is a web application that allows people to know to locations of potholes which affords them the
        ability to avoid routes or proceed cautiously when taking a route with potholes. Users of Pothole Tracker
        can add potholes to the application's map that is viewed by all users displaying the locations, severity, and
        (optionally) a photo of the pothole. Administrative access will be granted to Department of Transportation (DOT)
        officials to allow them to establish an order of precedence for road repairs.</p>
